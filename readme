C Purpose :
C
C The aim of the special interest group is to develop a standard processing
C method for eddycorrelation data. With such a standard method results will
C become better comparable. All important corrections can be carried out.
C These are:
C
C  - Correction of sonic-temperature for lateral velocity (deferred to
C    calibration routine).
C  - Correction of sonic-temperature for presence of humidity.
C  - Correction of sonic path length to make mean sonic temperature match
C    mean temperature according to a different device (e.g. thermocouple).
C  - Time-delay in the datafile between the different columns
C  - Yaw-correction to make Mean(V) --> 0
C  - Pitch-correction to make Mean(W) --> 0
C  - Roll-correction to make Cov(W,V) --> 0
C  - Frequency-reponse corrections for slow apparatus and path length
C    integration.
C  - Oxygen-correction for hygrometers which are sensitive for O2.
C  - Inclusion of the mean vertical velocity according to Webb.
C
C If you process your data using EC-Pack, please make a reference
C of the kind: "This data has been processed using EC-PACK version XX".
C This will make your data better exchangeable and comparable.

C or questions concerning EC-Pack, please contact us at the above
C address. To prevent the formation of EC-Pack dialects, and to bring
C bright insights to the attention and disposal of fellow researchers:

C
C Developments :
C - Better accessibility of frequency-response corrections
C - Separation of calibration routine from library
C - Detection of different trends and subsequent handling
C - Better documentation of all input/output variables and functionality
C   of subroutines
C - Flow distortion correction
C - Better standardisation of different types of functions

The library contains all non-IO routines.
It can be compiled with the command
   make libecpack.a
Which should produce the file libecpack.a


Two sample programs are included that use libecpack.a:
   ec_ncdf
   planfit (very preliminary)
