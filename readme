What    : This is the main README for ECPack. ECPack is a library 
          containing routines that can be used to process 
          eddy-covariance data. Furthermore, two programs are included
          (ecncdf and planang) which have their respective readme-files.

Revision: The revision history of the library van be found in the file Changelog
Website : More information about this software and the underlying physics
          can be found at the following web-site http://www.met.wau.nl/projects/jep

The source code is organized as follows:
* directory libsrc contains the code of the library: these routines
  are kept as general as possible: we have tried to remove/omit any references
  to routines that are specific to our own programs
* the directory src contains the source code of the programs ecncdf and planang, as well
  as some source files with routines used by those programs.
* the documentation of the library routines is build from the sources using robodoc, and
  will end up in the directory doc. When built the documentation is available in pdf and in
  html.
* the makefile contains rules to build both a linux and a windows executable (both to be compiled
  on a linux machine). The builds are done in separate directories (build-linux and build-win32).
  make win32         : makes the library for Win32 (in build-win32)
  make linux         : makes the library for linux (in build-linux)
  make win32-programs: makes ecncdf.exe and planang.exe for Win32 (in build-win32)
  make linux-programs: makes ecncdf and planang for linux (in build-linux)
  make docs          : makes the documentation (in doc)
  make all           : does all of the above

If you grabbed this software from out website, you probably have pre-built executables for Win32 
in the zip-file.


This software is the result of discussions in a special interest group 
The objective was to develop a standard processing
method for eddycorrelation data. With such a standard method results will
become better comparable. All important corrections are included in the library 
and can be carried out by the software.


  - Correction of sonic-temperature for lateral velocity (deferred to
    calibration routine).
  - Correction of sonic-temperature for presence of humidity.
  - Correction of sonic path length to make mean sonic temperature match
    mean temperature according to a different device (e.g. thermocouple).
  - Time-delay in the datafile between the different columns
  - Yaw-correction to make Mean(V) --> 0
  - Pitch-correction to make Mean(W) --> 0
  - Roll-correction to make Cov(W,V) --> 0
  - Frequency-reponse corrections for slow apparatus and path length
    integration.
  - Oxygen-correction for hygrometers which are sensitive for O2.
  - Inclusion of the mean vertical velocity according to Webb.
  - Planar-fit axis rotation

  - The software can deal with a number of sonic anemometers (Gill-Solent,
    Campbell CSAT, KayoDenki TR90 and TR61) and gas analyzers (Krypton
    hygrometer, Lymann-alpha hygrometer, LiCor 7500 H2O/CO2 analyzer).
  - The output of the processing software can be customized to a high degree,
    and in addition to the requested output, also the statistical error in all
    outputs can be given.

If you process your data using EC-Pack, please make a reference
of the kind: "This data has been processed using EC-PACK version XX".
This will make your data better exchangeable and comparable.
