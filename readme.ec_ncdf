C Purpose :
C
C The aim of the special interest group is to develop a standard processing
C method for eddycorrelation data. With such a standard method results will
C become better comparable. All important corrections can be carried out.
C These are:
C
C  - Correction of sonic-temperature for lateral velocity (deferred to
C    calibration routine).
C  - Correction of sonic-temperature for presence of humidity.
C  - Correction of sonic path length to make mean sonic temperature match
C    mean temperature according to a different device (e.g. thermocouple).
C  - Time-delay in the datafile between the different columns
C  - Yaw-correction to make Mean(V) --> 0
C  - Pitch-correction to make Mean(W) --> 0
C  - Roll-correction to make Cov(W,V) --> 0
C  - Frequency-reponse corrections for slow apparatus and path length
C    integration.
C  - Oxygen-correction for hygrometers which are sensitive for O2.
C  - Inclusion of the mean vertical velocity according to Webb.
C
C If you process your data using EC-Pack, please make a reference
C of the kind: "This data has been processed using EC-PACK version XX".
C This will make your data better exchangeable and comparable.

Usage
-----
The program is controlled by a large number of configuration files.

The program is invoked as:
   ec_ncdf < configfile
where configfile is the name of the main configuration file of which 
the structure is described below. Thus the configuration is read from 
standard input.
The hierarchy of configuration files is as follows (an arrow means that
the file from which the arrow points contains the name of the file
pointed to):

main configuration file
    |-> | processing parameter file 
        | interval file              -> | data file
        | flux output file              | intermediate results file
        | calibration files

Main configuration file
-----------------------
The main configuration file consits of two types of lines:
- lines with an assigment 
- comment lines (starting with //)
A known issue is that the file should NOT end with an empty line.

Assignments are of the form 

   VARNAME = VALUE
   
where VARNAME is one of a prescribed list of tokens and VALUE is the value
to be assigned (VALUE may be placed between quotes, but this is not necessary
as long as no spcaes are part of VALUE). VARNAME is case-insensitive
(i.e. VARNAME is equivalent to VarName), but VALUE may not be (on UNIX
path names are cases sensitive and names of variables in a NetCDF file
are also cases-sensitive).
As of version 2.5, one can control, through the main configuration
file, which data are written to the output file

Valid tokens are:
DatDir        directory for data files
OutDir        directory for output files (flux files, intermediate result file)
ParmDir       directory for parameter file (processing parameters, calibration
              files, interval files)

SonName       name of sonic calibration file 
CoupName      name of thermo couple calibration file
HygName       name of hygrometer calibration file
CO2Name       name of CO2 sensor calibration file

TCouple_var   name of thermocouple temperature variable in NetCDF file
Tref_var      name of thermocouple reference temperature variable in NetCDF file

              in kg/m^3 or the calibdation file should take care of that)
CO2_var       name of CO2 variables (CO2 concentration should be in kg/m^3 or the 
              calibration file should take care of that
HourMin_var   name of hour/minute variable in NetCDF file (presently this
              should be a la the Campbell hour/minutes: e.g. 1845 means

Processing parameter file
-------------------------
The parameter file contains information on how to process the data.
The information is expected on fixed line, so blank lines are significant!
At the moment parameter file consists of seven blocks:
1.  sample frequency
2.  limits on yaw and roll correction
3.  fixed ptch, yaw and roll angles
4.  limits on frequency response corrections factors
5.  'corrections' to perform
6.  switch for yes/no printing of intermediate results
7.  switches for which intermediate results to print

Below you will find an example of a parameter file
---------------start---------------------
20	FREQ	  = ! [Hz] Sample frequency datalogger	

30	YawLim	  = ! [degree] Limit when Mean(W) is turned to zero
30	RollLim   = ! [degree] Limit when Cov(V,W) is turned to zero	

0	PreYaw  = Fixed pitch angle for known tilt-correction	
0	PrePitch  = Fixed yaw angle for known tilt-correction
0	PreRoll   = Fixed roll angle for known tilt-correction	

0.85	LLimit	  = ! Smallest acceptable freq-response corr. factor	
1.15	ULimit	  = ! Largest acceptable freq-response corr. factor	

T	DoCrMean  = ! Replace mean quantities by better estimates	
T	DoDetren  = ! Correct data for linear trend	
T	DoSonic   = ! Correct sonic temperature for humidity	
F	DoTilt	  = ! Perform true tilt-correction with known angles
T	DoYaw   = ! Turn system such that Mean(V) --> 0	
T	DoPitch	  = ! Turn system such that Mean(W) --> 0
T	DoRoll	  = ! Turn System such that Cov(W,V) --> 0
T	DoFreq	  = ! Correct for poor frequency response
T	DoO2	  = ! Correct hygrometer for oxygen-sensitivity
T	DoWebb	  = ! Calculate mean velocity according to Webb
T       DoStruct  = ! Calculate structure coefficients			

F	DoPrint   = ! Skip printing intermediate results or not?	

T	PRaw	  = Indicator if these intermediate results are wanted
T	PCal	  = Indicator if these intermediate results are wanted
T	PDetrend  = Indicator if these intermediate results are wanted	
T	PIndep	  = Indicator if these intermediate results are wanted
T	PTilt	  = Indicator if these intermediate results are wanted
T	PYaw	  = Indicator if these intermediate results are wanted
T	PPitch	  = Indicator if these intermediate results are wanted
T	PRoll	  = Indicator if these intermediate results are wanted
T	PSonic	  = Indicator if these intermediate results are wanted
T	PO2	  = Indicator if these intermediate results are wanted
T	PFreq	  = Indicator if these intermediate results are wanted
T	PWebb	  = Indicator if these intermediate results are wanted
0.15    StructSep = separation (in m) used for calculation of structure parameters
T       DoPF      = Do planar fit untilting (requires that untilting angles have been produced before with planang)
T       PPF       = Print intermediate results after planar fit untilting
0.99    PFValid   = Fraction of samples that should be valid to inclue interval in planar fit calculation (see readme.planang)
------------end----------------

If you use planar fit untilting, the 'classic' axis rotation should be switched
of (using both planar fit and 'classic' doesn't make sense, since in
the end you would only see the effect of the 'classic ' method.
However, the planar fit method does not turn the system into
the mean wind. herefore, it is practical to keep the Yaw correction switched on.
This will ensure that mean(v) becomes zero (please refer to the
definition of the specfile given above to find the correct line where 
the Yaw correction is switched on or off, there has been confusion about what is
Yaw and what is pitch: spec files that are copies of copies of copies of
old spec files might have the wrong naming!

Interval file
-------------
The interval file describes for which times intervals fluxes have to be 
computed from which data files etc.
The format is:
- One blank line (can be used for a heading, comments ...)
- one line per interval, where the interval is described with the
following columns:

1. Starting day of year number
2. Starting hour
3. Starting minutes
4. End day of year number 
5. End hour
6. End minutes
7. Water vapour density (in kg/m3) from a slow sensor (used to correct for
   drift of the fast hygrometer)
8. Atmopheric pressure (in Pa)
9. Name of data file
10. Name of file for intermediate results

Note that the program determines the time interval such that the datapoint
should have a time that corresponds a doy,hour,minute combination within
the interval specified, including the start time, but excluding the end time
This implies that e.g.
the interval 
  255 13 00 255 13 30 
corresponds to all samples between (inclusive) 255,13:00:00 and 255,13:30:00
(this different from the behaviour before version has changed as of 

Calibration files
-----------------
The structure of the calibration files is identical for all sensors.
The file consists of 28 lines, with one number per line. The order of the 
lines is significant and no blank lines should be present.
An example of a calibration file is given below. Explantion for
some parameters follows after the example file.

-------------stop------------------------

QQType:    now 10 types of sensors are known:
           1 : Campbell Sonic (also works for Gill, except for wind direction!)
	   2 : thermo couple (undefined type)
	   3 : Krypton hygrometer
	   4 : PT100 thermometer
	   5 : Psychrometer (used for what?)
	   6 : wind tunnel calibrated sonic anemometer
	   7 : Mierij Lymann-alpha
	   8 : LiCor7500 IR H20/CO2 sensor
	   9 : Kaijo Denki TR90 3-D sonic
	   10: Kaijo Denki TR61 3-D sonic
QQX, QQY and QQZ:
           are used for frequency response corrections
QQFunc:    Two types of fit functions are available
           1 : Polynomial
	   2 : logarithmic polynomial
QQExt1 to QQExt5:
           These are used to specify calibration factors specific to a
	   type of sensor (for QQType = 6, six extra calibration factors
	   are available (QQExt6 to QQExt11) to define the wind tunnel 
	   calibration; see Wind tunnel calibrated sonic).
The gain and offset are used for all apparatuses (it is done directly
after reading the samples). The calibration curve is presently only used
for the thermocouple (QQType = 2),  hygrometer (i.e. QQType is 3, 7 or 8) 
and the CO2 signal (QQType = 8). Make sure that -at least for those
apparatuses where the calibration curve is used- you enter sensible 
values for QQFunc, QQC0, QQC1 and QQOrder (for just a one-to-one conversion,
enter 1, 0, 1 and 1, respectively).

See section on Program internals on how gain, offset and calibration 
polynomials are treated.

Data file
---------
A NetCDF file. The file is searched for the variables specified in the
main configuration file. All attributes to variables are ignored (including
units) except for 'scale_factor' and 'add_offset'. How these are treated
in combination with gain and offset and calibration read from the
calibration file is treated in the section on Program internals.
The variables in the file, or the variables in combination with
the various gain and offsets (in NetCDF file or calibration file) and
the calibration curve given in the calibration file should have
the following units:
U      : m/s
V      : m/s
W      : m/s
TSonic : Celcius (since there is no easy way to convert the sonic temperature
         in the calibration file; anyhow, degree Celcius is a permitted
	 SI unit)
TCouple: Celcius (to remain compatible with the sonic temperature)
rhov   : kg/m^3 (was g/m^3, until Sept 18, 2002)
rhoCO2 : kg/m^3 (was none, until Sept 18, 2002)
Tref   : Celcius (a compromise, since there is no calibration file for 
         the reference temperature it's not easy to change it's units)
The time in the file is supposed to be in the terrific Campbell HHMM format.


Intermediate results file
-------------------------
A (possibly huge) text file that gives information on a variety of
things:
- data file from which data where read
- time interval
- time scales
- all (cross-correlations) between calibrated variables
- the latter can be shown after each correction/operation on the data
For each time interval this file is started again (so if you want to
store intermediate results from more than one time interval, they should
have different neames for each time interval; this is defined in
the interval file).

Flux output file
----------------
The flux output file contains one line per interval, stating the number of
samples read, means, variances and covariances of variables as well as
the tolerances of those quantities. A header line explains the contents.
For each complete run of the program (comprising various time intervals
as defined in the interval file) the data are appended.
One can either use a predefined set of columns (set Output='old' 
in the main configuration file) or defined the required columns
yourselve (set Output='new' and define the columns in the
main configuration file).

Program internals
-----------------
A number of details on the internal operation of the program will be
discussed here.

Gain, offset etc.
.................
The order in which the various gains, offsets and calibrations are applied
to the data is as follows:  
- if scale_factor present     : sample = sample * scale_factor
- if add_offset present       : sample = sample + add_offset
- gain from calibration file  : sample = sample / gain
- offset from calibration file: sample = sample + offset
- calibrtion curve            : sample = calibration_function(sample)

Frequency response correction
.............................
Due to lack of information on the cospectra of u and v with scalars
and of different scalars, the frequency respsonse correction is
only applied to variances and to covariances of scalars with 
the vertical velocity w.

Thermo couple
.............
If no name for a reference temperature variable is given in the main
configuration file (i.e. Tref_var is empty) it is assumed that the
variabele Tcouple_var contains the temperature itself (in deg Celsius)
If a reference temperature IS given, it is assumed that the variables
Tcouple_var contains a voltage, which is the voltage between the
actual sensor and the reference junction. The temperature is then 
determined as:
  T = f(voltage + f^-1(reference T))
where f is the calibration function given in the calibration file, and
f^-1 is the inverse of the calibration function. It is assumed that 
the calibration function yields a temperature in degrees Celsius. The
reference temperature is also supposed to be in degrees Celcius.

This procedure is
in accordance with what is done in the P14 instruction of the Campbell
dataloggers.

Krypton hygrometer
..................
The calibration of the Krypton hygrometer as given in the manual of the instrument is not really compatible with the way in which calibrations
are treated in the present program. According to the Krypton manual
the calibration is:
   ln(V) = ln(V0) - rho x K
where V is the output voltage, V0 is the voltage in absence of water vapour,
x is the path length and K is the effective extinction coefficient. In order
to convert this calibration to a (log) polynomial, the calibration 
curve has to be fitted to either model. This implies that when the path length
is changed, a new calibration curve needs to be fitted (of course no 
recalibration needed). To cope with the 'wet' calibration and
'dry' calibration as suggested by Campbell a second order log-polynomial can be
used.

LiCor 7500 IR hygrometer / CO2 sensor
.....................................
You have a variety of choices in the output of this sensor. ec_ncdf wants
densities in kg/m^3. You can either to the ppm -> density conversion
in the datalogger program, or in the calibration file of ec_ncdf
(or even through the gain/offset mechanism of NetCDF, but this is 
less transparent).


Sonic temperature
-----------------
If no thermocouple is present, the sonic temperature is used for the
calculations where a temperature is needed. But in order to derive specific
humidty from either Krypton or Lymann-alpha data, one needs a temperature.
On the other hand one part of the Schotanus et al. correction for the
sonic temperature depends on specific humidity. Therefore, a temporary 
temperature is constructed with both parts of the Schotanus correction
applied (where the humidity part is done iteratively:
find the correct temperature and specific humidity for the given absolute
humidity and sonic temperature). The resulting temperature is used
to determine the specific humidity.
The actual humidity part of the Schotanus correction is applied only to the
averaged data, not to the raw data.

Wind tunnel calibrated sonic
----------------------------
At KNMI sonic anemometers are -sometimes- calibrated in a wind tunnel
to determine the directional dependence of the signal. As of version 1.05
of ec_ncdf this can be dealt with. For this purpose a new instrument
type, QQType = 6, has been introduced. For this type six extra extra
calibration factors have to be defined in the calibration file (add
six lines at the end for QQExt6 t QQExt11).

The method is based on a wind tunnel calibration of the sonic
The real velocity components can be derived from the measured components 
and the real azimuth and elevation angle. But the latter are not known
and have to be determined iteratively from the measured components.
The relationship between the real components and the measured components is:

  Ureal =  Umeas/(UC1*(1 - 0.5* 
                  ((Azi + (Elev/0.5236)*UC2)* (1 - UC3*Abs(Elev/0.5236)))**2 )

  Vreal =  Vmeas*(1 - VC1*Abs(Elev/0.5236))

where UC1, UC2, UC3, VC1, WC1, WC2 are fitting coefficients (corresponding
to QQExt6, QQExt7, QQExt8, QQExt9, QQExt10 and QQExt11, respectively).
An azimuth angle of zero is supposed to refer to a wind
direction from the most optimal direction (i.e. the 'open'
side of a sonic). Samples with an absolute azimuth angle of
more than 40 degrees are rejected.
