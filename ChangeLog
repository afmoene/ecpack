Changelog of ec_ncdf/ecpack
Revision 1.05/1.06: September 18, 2000: 
          - changed in physconst.inc the sensitivity of Krypton to O2 from 
	    old 'Webb' value (0.0085) to  Arjan van Dijk's value
	    (0.0038 m^3 g^-1 cm^-1)
          - added support for wind tunnel calibrated sonic anemometer
	    (see description in readme)
Revision 1.07/1.08: October 18, 2000: 
          - in calibration of wind tunnel calibrated sonic: check for valid
	    wind direction before interation
Revision 1.09: November 1, 2000: 
          - check for validity of Tref (for thermocouple calibration) 
	    -> Tref is in Celcius, not Kelvin !
          - fixed error in sonic calibration (azimuth angle replaced 
	    elevation angle)
Revision 1.10: February 28, 2001:
          - fixed an error in computation of density of dry air (it was 
	    correct in the original version of ECpack but incorrectly 
	    changed by me (AM).
Revision 1.11: April 3, 2001: 
          - added output of mean W and its tolerance (as obtained before 
	    tilt correction. Data are written to additional column in flux 
	    file
Revision 1.12/1.13: May 28, 2001:
          - reading of NetCDF data speeded up considerably, especially at
	    end of file: now seek in file where data should be read (rather
	    than crawling through it, sample by sample)
          - now we can deal with files without sonic temperatures. In those
	    calibrations where temperature is needed, sonic temperature
	    is automatically replaced by thermocouple temperature.
Revision 1.14: May 30, 2001:
          - Made search for time interval more robust (also works if sample
	    at start of interval is not present.
	  - Now take care that some quantities derived with missing data
	    (i.e. variances etc.) are flagged in the output as dummy (-9999).
	    This is not yet finished.
	  - Now also dump min/max of samples to intermediate results file
	    (not to flux file !)
Revision 1.15: May 31, 2001:
          - Search for time interval even more robust. If interval starts
	    before start of file, first sample in the file is supposed to
	    be the start of the interval. If the interval ends beyond end 
	    of file, the interval is now supposed to run until the last
	    sample in the file.
          - Fixed a bug that erroneously flagged some covariances as invalid
	    after axis rotation (bug appeared in previsou revision)
Revision 1.16: Jun 11, 2001
          - Added Mierij Lymann-Alpha hygrometer as an apparatus (number 7).
          - Oxygen correction for hygrometer now depends on type of hygrometer
           (either Lymann-Alpha or Krypton).
          - Swapped names of Yaw and Pitch routines and variables. In 
	    the configuration and calibration files the switches for the 
	    rotations are still read in the correct order (so with names
	    swapped: Yaw-correction to make Mean(V) --> 0, 
	    Pitch-correction to make Mean(W) --> 0). In other words: do not
	    change the configuration files; this change is purely internal.
          - now unkown values should appear in output as dummies (-9999)
	  - search for interval in data file now also can handle files 
	    without a 'seconds' variable.
Revision 1.17: June 11, 2001
          - fixed bug in search for interval when no seconds info is present
	    in file
          - in search for interval: sometimes first period of data was
	    erroneously assumed to be not present: fixed.
Revision 1.18: June 12, 2001
          - Removed write statement that did writing to intermediate results
	    file while file was not open (gave fort.14 file)
          - Removed redunant debugging write statement
	  - Now report version number and RCS-Id of ec_ncdf.f at startup
Revision 1.19: Jun 14, 2001
          - in time interval searching: skip points at start of file
	    and at end of file for which either DOY or HOURMIN is negative.
	    In this way missing values for either DOY or HOURMIN (-32767)
	    are not spoiling the search routine.
Revision 1.20: June 21, 2001
          - inclusion of planar fit method in ecpack.f
	  - inclusion correction for obstruction in ecpack.f
	  - change in ECMapVec in ecpack.f: indices of mapping interchanged
	  - indices interchanged in mappings in routines that use ECMapVec
	    (implicitly: ECKRoll, ECKYaw and ECKPitch)
	  - change in ECMapMtx in ecpack.f: indices of mapping interchanged
	  - indices interchanged in mappings in routines that use ECMapMtx:
	    ECRotate)
          - MaxRhoV in physcnst.inc changed from 100 to 1 (in kg/m3 !!)
Revision 1.21: June 25, 2001
          - fixed error in time interval search routine (now really discards
	    samples with incorrect DOY and/or HOURMIN.
Reivision 1.22: August 2, 2001
          - Yaw and Pitch changed in numbers of variables of calibration
	    constants (QQYaw and QQPitch) in parcnst.inc.
          - Changed rotation of samples in calibration routine (rotated
	    over 180 degrees less)
          - inverted V-velocities in calibration routine (this is at least 
	    valid -apparently- for the CSAT3).
Revision 1.23: October 31, 2001
          - included updated planerfit routines (in fact the ones in the
	    previous revision where older than available at that moment);
	    the dimensions of UMean are reversed relative to what 
	    Arjan has.
          - fixed bug in ECCorrec when tilt-correction is done
	    with known angles (arguments of ECKYaw, ECKPitch and ECKRoll
	    were incorrect)
          - in ECReadNetCDF: now handle correctly the situation
	    when there are no samples in the file
          - removed HAVE_UNCAL from argument list of ECYaw
Revision 2.00: November 1, 2001
          - Routines have been renamed and grouped in appropriate files
	  - A start has been made to separate different functions in 
	    corrections: calculate correction and subsequently apply it.
Revision 2.01: February 13, 2002
          - Now empty NetCDF files are dealt with correctly (empty
	    in the sense of: no samples).
          - Maximum number of samples is jumped to 100000. This allows
	    analysis of 83 minutes of data sampled at 20 Hz.
Revision 2.2: April 22, 2002
          - Code is now GPL'de
	  - started conversion of documentation to robodoc format
	  - now makefile builds separate library and two demo programs
Revision 2.2.1: April 23, 2002
          - changed a variable name in planar fit routines
Revision 2.2.2: July 3, 2002
          - added chack on value of diagnostic (if available): sample is
	    flagged invalid if diagnostic < 0 or > 100 (check has been disabled             since  version of June 2000)
Revision 2.3: August 30, 2002
          - added Robodoc documentation to ec_corr.f, ec_math.f, ec_phys.f,
	    physcnst.inc, parcnst.inc
          - added commands to Makefile for generation of HTML and Tex docs
	  - added IMPLICIT NONE's to routines in ec_corr.f, ec_math.f and
	    ec_phys.f
          - removed a number of unnecessary include statements
          - moved text manipulation routines from ec_gene.f to ec_text.f
	    and renamed them from EC_G_* to EC_T_*
Revision 2.4: October 8, 2002
          - changes to parcnst.inc: added CO2 as a quantity, added LiCor7500
	    as apparatus
          - EC_F_GetConf adapted to reading CO2 variable name and calibration 
	    file
          - adjusted calibration routine for inclusion of CO2
	  - EC_G_Main: removed calcomm.inc and added FirstDay to interface
	    to pass it to calibration routine. FirstDay also added
	    to calibration routine in ec_ncdf.f
          - Changed all references to HAVE_CALSON etc. to HAVE_UNCAL(U) ...
	    in order to get rid of calcomm.inc
          - moved filling of QName and UName to parcnst.inc (rather than EC_G_Main)
	  - changed order of quantities: CO2 moved to just after TTime.
	  - CO2 now passes through calibration routine (just copied); Also
	    specific CO2 is determined
	  - removed reference to columns in Rawsampl from EC_F_NetCDF: now
	    quantities have same column number in raw sample and in calibrated
	    sample
	  - changed default UNITS of temperature to Kelvin (was Celcius) and
	    to kg/m^3 for rhov and rhoCO2 (was g/m^3). Reference temperature is
	    still in Celcius (since there is no calibration file for it)
          - EC_F_ReadNCDF: removed N from interface
	  - physcnst.inc: lowered Epsilon to 1e-20 (because of CO2 low variances
	    used in computation of correlation coefficients).
          - Oxygen correction knows about LiCor7500 (do nothing !)
          - rewrite of freq. response routine so that factors G and INTTS
	    are 2D arrays with quantity numbers as index, added CO2 and
	    discovered (but not solved !) that freq. response factors are
	    calculated only for variances and for covariances of a scalar
	    with vertical velocity.
          - addad CalCO2 to interface of EC_C_Main
	  - added FCO2 and FCO2Webb (and their tolerances) to EC_Ph_Flux and
	    its interface.Accordingly changed call to EC_Ph_Flux in
	    EC_G_Main; changed interface of EC_G_Main (and call to it) to
	    include CO2 fluxes.
          - added support for CO2 to ec_ncdf. For the moment the results are
	    written to the flux file in columns following the existing
	    columns. This may change in the future.
          - fixed error in EC_Ph_Struct: added IMPLICIT NONE and include
	    'parcnst.inc' (needed for constamts U,V, and W).
          - added validity ranges for CO2 in physcnst.inc, to be used in
	    calibration routine to raise a flag about validity.
          - added two new apparatus types: ApKaijoTR90 (=9) and
	    ApKaijoTR61 (=10) for the two respective Kaijo Denki type
	    sonic anemometers. This is relevant for the calibration
	    routine, where the samples are rotated by 90 degrees.
          - seem to have corrected the eternal wind direction problem:
	    take orientation angle as given in calibration file (orientation
	    relative to North) negative in calibration routine.
          - EC_C_Webb now passes Webb velocity trhough its interfaces rather
	    than through the array Mean (where it addresses Mean(W)).
	    EC_C_Main and EC_Ph_Flux have adapted accordingly.
          - The output writing in ecncdf.f now checks whether Webb-correction
	    has been requested. If not, then the Webb terms are set to
	    -9999 and the summed flux just gives the covariance flux.
          - moved filling of variable name and unit strings to parcnt.inc
	  - started to check source with ftnchek (not finished yet)
Revision 2.4.1: October 9, 2002 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
          - Change ApGillSonic to ApCSATSonic (since the way it works now is
	    correct for a CSAT, but not for a Gill (in terms of wind direction).
          - updated some parts in the readme.ec_ncdf
	  - improved alignment of column headings with column data in output
	    of ec_ncdf
Revision 2.4.2: October 10, 2002 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
          - fixed bug in call to EC_C_Main in EC_G_Main (pressure and
	    web velocity were interchanged -> wrong density in EC_Ph_Flux
Revision 2.4.3: January 7, 2003 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
          - added 4 columns in output of ec_ncdf: counters for occurrence of CSAT diagnostic
            flags
          - added extra line in output of ec_ncdf: units per column
          - changes in ec_gene.f, ec_ncdf.f and ec_file.f to
            accomodate the use of planar fit untilting
          - new program (planang) added that calculates untilting matrix. The
            periods for which matrix is to be determined is read from 
            text file. Matrix is written to a text file, to be read by 
            ec_ncdf.
          - interface changed of ec_f_getconf, ec_f_params, ec_g_main
          - changes neede in the configureation file (names of files) and
            the parameter file (or 'spec' file): also info
            on planar fit rotation is read.
          - repaired validity limits for temperature (thermocouple). Were changed
            to Kelvin, now in Celcius again.
          - converted StartTime and StopTime into integers (in ec_ncdf, planang
            EC_F_ReadNCDF and EC_F_GetPF
Revision 2.4.4: January 14, 2003
          - writing og planar fit angles by planang fixed (sometimes no spacing)
          - moved planar fit rotation of samples to very start of all rotation stuff (in EC_G_Main)
          - Now wind direction should be correct irrespective of whether one uses planar
            fit only, or with yaw-rotation, or the 'classic' one-run rotations (yaw, pitch and roll).
          - computation of vector wind and wind direction has been moved to EC_Ph_Flux
          - output of ec_ncdf now gives real vector wind, rather than mean(U) (which is meaningless
            when the coordinate system is not turned into the mean wind.
          - likewise u* and tau are now calculated such that both cov(u,w) and cov(v,w) are taken
            into account.
          - 12 extra columns have been added to the output of ec_ncdf (why not!), giving the mean 
            velocity components and the components of the stress tensor (it's becoming time
            for output-on-demand).
          - added some checks to EC_G_Reset (related to CO2)
	  - removed leading spaces in writing hear to flux file in ec_ncdf
Revision 2.4.5:  January 29, 2003
          - Now (in parcnts.inc) have separate indices for calibrate and
	    uncalibrated quantities. Hopefully replaced have_uncal by have_cal
	    where appropriate in all source files (ec_file.f, ec_gene.f,
	    ec_corr.f, ec_ncdf.f)
	  - Implemented QPhys and dQPhys to replace endless lists of physical
	    quantities
	  - Implemented Std and dStd in ec_ncdf.f to replace endless lists
	    of standard deviations
	  - Moved information about which corrections to do, which info
	    to print to intermediate file to arrays of logicals
	    (to reduce length of interface of routines, and reduce chance
	    of bugs). Variables that describe certain experimental
	    settings (such as sampling freq., preyaw etc.) moved to
	    array as well.
	  - All source checked with ftnchek (not bothered about arrayness
	    mismatches!)
	  - removed y from interface of EC_M_Detren since it causes aliasing
	    (and is not necessary to arrive at the same result).
	  - fixed error in EC_Ph_Flux in computation of Ustar (bug present
	    since 2.4.4)
Revision 2.5: January 30, 2003 (Arnold.Moene@wur.nl)
      - removed Doy, HourMin and Sec as calibrated quantities (all
	    their info is in TTime)
      - code cleaning
	  - now flexible output is possible: in the main configuration
	    file one can define which variables you want to see
	    in the output file (see readme.ec_ncdf for details).
Revision 2.5.1: February 3, 2003 (Arnold.Moene@wur.nl)
      - added option (on by default) to write version number of
	    program and data of processing to flux output file of ec_ncdf
	    (output='version' or output='noversion' in configuration file).
	    Makes debugging easier if someone has a problem, but
	    doesn't know with what version the results were produced.
Revision 2.5.2: March 11, 2003 (Arnold.Moene@wur.nl)
      - fixed error in wind direction of 180 degrees: now should work
	    with planar fit and classic axis rotation: a change in ec_Ph_flux
	    and in ec_g_main.
Revision 2.5.3: June 3, 2003 (Arnold.Moene@wur.nl)
      - fixed wind direction again
Revision 2.5.4: August 20, 2003 (Arnold.Moene@wur.nl)
      - now reset contents of calibration info to DUMMY (in planang and ec_ncdf)
	  - New routine in ec_phys to calculate Obukhov length (for use in freq. response correction)
	  - Now use new routine for Obukhov length  in freq. response correction in ec_corr
	  - fixed bug in writing of flux file: in new format intervals with zero samples
         repeated data from last interval with more than zero samples. Now handled correctly.
Revision 2.5.5: August 28, 2003 (Arnold.Moene@wur.nl)
      - fixed incorrect (or incomplete) computation of sensor separation in EC_C_F01 (the
        frequency response correction routines). Before the fix, only the horizontal separation
        in X was taken into account (in fact for all except the thermocouple only the
        actual X-location of the sensor, not the distance from the sonic focal point).
        Y and Z separation was not taken into account at all. For now it is assumed that
        the direction of the separation is not relevant in the separation-correction
        (i.e. neither the orientation with respect to the vertical, nor the orientation
        relative to the mean wind dieection is taken into account).
Revision: 2.5.6: October 9, 2003 (Arnold.Moene@wur.nl)
      - Now Schotanus side-wind correction is in accordance with written documentation:
        it depends on the type of sonic (i.e. the angle of the 'temperature sonic path' with
        the vertical (30 degrees for CSAT, 45 degrees for Gill/Solent, 0 degrees for Kaijos).
        Before for all sonics it was assumed that this angle was zero.
      - Introduced new sensor (number 11): de ApGillSolent (Gill Solent anemometer).
Revision : 2.5.7: January 5, 2003 (Arnold.Moene@wur.nl)
      - Now the output of 'number of samples' per calibrated signal has to be selected as well in
        the configuration file (through Out_Num = quanatity). The total number
        of samples (irrespective of validity) is still given in the column
        following the time columns.
      - The order of the blocks of output has been changes so that physical
        quantities are at the end, and within physical quantities, the fluxes
        are at the end.
      - added initialization of a to EC_M_ELL1Q
      - added initializations of variables in EC_C_F01 and EC_C_Oxygen1
      - changed order of calculation in EC_Ph_Flux to make sure variables are
        initialized
      - renamed physical variables VectWind and DirFrom to U_vect and U_dir
        (but in configuration file old names still work)
Revision : 2.5.8: January 7, 2003 (Arnold.Moene@wur.nl)
      - in EC_T_STRIPSTR: now check also whether we pass passed end of string
        while removeing leasing spaces (went wrong with empty strings)
      - in EC_G_Main: diagnostics reset before adding
      - in calibration routine: if no seconds in uncalibrated variables, make
        time from index, rather than real time; note that this has changed the
        interface; also NOTE that before this version, detrending data from a
        file without a 'seconds' variable was more or less uncorrect (all
        samples from a particular minute were attributed to the first second
        of that minute
      - EC_G_Reset now also resets MIndep and CIndep; this has changed the
        interface and all calls have been changed accordingly
      - fixed formats in ec_file for writing as CSV
Revision : 2.5.9: February 10, 2004 (Arnold.moene@wur.nl)
      - changed directory structure to make separation between library and
        programs clearer
      - changed makefile structure (now build both linux and win32 binaries on
        linux)
      - removed transfer function in frequency correction that corrected
        for pre-filtering, since we know of no one that applies pre-filtering
      - updated main readme file to reflect new directory structure
Revision : 2.5.10: April 21, 2004 (Arnold.moene@wur.nl)
      - removed sidewind correction (Schotanus) in calibrat.f for CSAT3. We
        have overlooked that the CSAT does this correction online (see CSAT
        manual, page 1, section 2, sentence 3). Thanks to Ed Swiatek for the
        detailed information.
Revision : 2.5.11: May 10, 2004 (Arnold.Moene@wur.nl)
      - in ec_file.f, routine EC_F_GetPF: at end also *close* PlfFile. Not
        closing this file did not give problems under windows, but did under
        Linux: for the next interval the routine didn't start at the beginning
        of the planar fit angles file
      - forgot to update version.inc for 2.5.10: now set to 2.5.11
Revision : 2.5.12: September 21, 2004 (Arnold.Moene@wur.nl)
      - added speed of sound (QUSSpeed) as an uncalibrated signal
        (parconst.inc)
      - added conversion routine (in ec_phys.f) to go from speed of sound
        to sonic temperature
      - in ec_file.f: name of sonic speed of sound is added to be read from
        configuration file (name is SSpeed_Var)
      - in calibrat: if no sonic temperature is given in data file, but
        speed of sound is, sonic temperature is determined from speed of sound
Revision : 2.5.13: October 12, 2004 (Arnold.Moene@wur.nl)
      - Lv is made temperature dependent (as used in EC_Ph_Flux). This is only
        partially correct: we *should* use the temperature at which
        evaporation takes place. Furthermore, the latent heat of fusion of ice
        should be used if ice is the source of water vapour.
      - Cp is made temperature dependent (based on observed air temperature)
Revision : 2.5.14: March 22, 2005 (arnold.Moene@wur.nl)
      - implemented framework to read switches for corrections, as well as
      parameters needed in corrections from the configuration file (to phase
      out the use of the 'spec' file).
      - implemented detrending by block averaging (i.e. per block the mean
      value of the signal is subtracted). Note that this is not the same as
      block detrending in combination with adding th eovariance of the blocks!
      - fixed bug in calculation of error in u* and Tau. If you have data from
      a previous version of ecpack, just divide d(u*) by the square of u*, and
      divide d(tau) by square of u*
      - in ec_file: EC_F_Params is now called from EC_F_GetConf and no longer
      from the application (ec_ncdf or planang) directly
Revision : 2.5.15: April 28, 2005 (arnold.Moene@wur.nl)
      - fixed bug in invocation of EC_get_conf in ec_ncdf (corrpar and expvar were interchanged)
Revision : 2.5.16: August 14, 2006 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
      - added option to ec_ncdf to write extra columns regarding the start and
      stop time of the interval: switch Out_Time (see readme.ec_ncdf)
      - if DoCrMean is set to true in the parameter file, at least the mean(q)
      is give in the output
      - check if sonic instrument file (named 'SonName') really contains info
      about a sonic now also checks for ApGillSolent (i.e. number 11).
Revision : 2.5.17: June 4, 2008 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
     - removed double code in ec_G_main (Statistics after deterending
     - fixed small in writing of header (label for #samples column was
     missing)
Revision : 2.5.18: October 21, 2008 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
     - order of ExpVar and CorrPar in argument of EC_G_Main (routine and way
     it was called) was inconsistent (probably since version 2.5.14). One of
     the most visible effects was that no frequency response correction was
     performed. Hence a major bug (now fixed).
     - in EC_F_Wflux: increased length of character strings FRM etc.
     - in EC_G_ShwInd: changed format 10
     - fixed slatec.f (precision definitions)
Revision: 2.5.19: November 3, 2008 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
     - introduced generic sonic with extra calibration coefficients
     (not yet thoroughly checked).
Revision: 2.5.20: November 3, 2008 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
     - Frequency response correction: 
       * set upper limit of integration to 0.5 times sampling frequency; 
       * switched off the data aquisition co-spectral transfer function (this has a small effect)
       * increased number of intervals in integration to 39
       * changed TRANA/GAINV*GAIND to TRANA*GAINV*GAIND (GAINV and GAIND have
       always been unity so the effect is none).
Revision: 2.5.21:
       * changed in bench/spec_test.dat: yaw limit to pitch limit
       * changed in bench/*qq files: yaw to pitch and vice versa
       * fixed bug in computation of standard deviations in ec_ncdf.f: were set to -9999 due to check on number of samples
       * converted tabs to spaces in some files
Revision: 2.5.22:
       * ec_file.f: default value for ExpVar(QEPFValid) set to 1 (rather than 0).
       * check if planar fit angles were valid
       * planang.f: write dummy if planar fit angles could not be calculated
